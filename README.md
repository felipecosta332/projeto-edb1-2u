## DIM0119 - Basic Data Structures I

### Prof. Guilherme Fernandes de Ara√∫jo

#### Definition

- Single, pairs of 2 or trios of 3
- Choose one or two sorting algorithms

#### To implement

- Measure the main execution time of the algorithm
- Generate a reasonable number of test instances at random (n varied)
- Explain the complexity of the algorithm implemented
- Generate a graph with the execution times and present, comparing with the complexity

#### Report

- In PDF format (text or slides)
