## DIM0119 - Basic Data Structures I

### Prof. Guilherme Fernandes de Ara√∫jo

#### Definition

- Single, pairs of 2 or trios of 3
- Choose one or two simple algorithms (linear search, binary search, fibonacci, power, etc.)

#### To implement

- Measure the main execution time of the algorithm
- Generate a reasonable number of test instances at random (n varied)
- Explain the complexity of the algorithm implemented
- Generate a graph with the execution times and present, comparing with the complexity

#### Report

- In PDF format (text or slides)
- Present in up to 10 min (up to 15 min depending on how many groups fit on time) 17/09/2020 - 07:30 am
- Deliver via SIGAA 16/09/2020 23:59
